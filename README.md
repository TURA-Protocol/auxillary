# TURA Protocol Auxiliary

## Overview

This repository contains the auxiliary smart contracts and utilities that support the core functionality of the TURA (Tokenized Universal Risk Arbitrage) protocol. These components enhance the protocol's capabilities, provide essential services, and improve the overall user experience.

## Key Components

1. Oracle Services
2. Liquidity Management
3. Analytics and Reporting
4. User Interface Helpers
5. Cross-Chain Bridge Interfaces

## Smart Contracts

### 1. TURAOracle.sol

## Utilities

### 1. Data Fetchers

- Scripts for fetching and processing off-chain data

### 2. UI Helpers

- JavaScript libraries to simplify dApp integration

### 3. Simulation Tools

- Tools for simulating arbitrage opportunities and risk scenarios

## Usage

Each component in this repository is designed to work seamlessly with the TURA core contracts. Refer to individual component documentation for specific usage instructions.

## Security

While these contracts and utilities are crucial for the TURA ecosystem, they interact with external services and handle sensitive operations. Therefore:

- All contracts undergo rigorous testing, but use them at your own risk.
- We encourage security researchers to review our code and report any vulnerabilities.
